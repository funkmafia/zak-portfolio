        description: "I wanted this game to feel like more than just clicking through levels. The idea was to pull the user into an escape-room scenario; full of suspense, logic, and decision-making. Something that will make you have to think on your feet, like Batman. All done by using JavaScript timers, conditional flows, and modular logic; I built a browser-based riddle game that pushed me to balance gameplay, UX, and speed.",
